            <p>The 60th Anniversary Jaguar models celebrate the introduction of Fender’s top-of-the-line offset
                instrument of 1962. The Jaguar was introduced as Fender’s premium offering and was advertised as a
                “faster, more comfortable guitar.”</p>
            <p>The 60th Anniversary Jaguar is instantly recognizable with its iconic offset-waist body, slinky 24” short
                scale, elegant bound rosewood fingerboard inlaid with pearloid block position markers and matching
                painted headstock. Other era correct details include an alder body with nitrocellulose lacquer finish,
                lead/rhythm circuit, "F" tuners and Jaguar tremolo system with adjustable string mute.</p>
            <p>A pair of 60th Anniversary Jaguar pickups provide a host of inspiring tones, ranging from slashing rhythm
                sounds to round, warm lead tones. The guitar features an engraved neckplate with a 60th anniversary
                logo, which is also embroidered on the interior of the included hardshell case. Offered in two
                vintage-inspired colors, Mystic Dakota Red and Mystic Lake Placid Blue, this model will be available in
                very limited numbers.</p>
